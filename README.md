MW3 Infected for Minecraft
What is "Infected"? 

Infected is a popular game mode from Call of Duty's Modern Warfare 3. This plugin tries its' best to replicate that 
gamemode and turn it into a Minecraft minigame. The objective of this game for humans is to simply outlast and fight 
the zombies. But you only have one life. Once you get bitten, then you turn into a zombie and are forced to infect 
the ones who were once your allies and friends. Humans. If you happen to get caught by the horde, your objective as 
a zombie is to infect all the humans before the timer is up.
