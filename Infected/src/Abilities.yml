# Default Abilities.yml, Last Edited in v1.8.3
# Regular is the default zombie, it applies an effect for 1 second
# PotionID:Durtaion:Power


# Chances for players to have an ability
# Chances work like this:
# Chance to be a regular is 100, and chance for everything else is 20-30
# All together its 215
# So if the random is <101 theyll be a regular zombie
# If its >100 and <131 they'll be a tank zombie
# If its >130 and <161 they'll be a Runner zombie
# If its >160 and <181 they'll be a Ghost zombie
# And so on...
